A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including
any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables
that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read
from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables
passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

      roles:
         - { role: ansible-role-dockerswarm, x: 42 }
